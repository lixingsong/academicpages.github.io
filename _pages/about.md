I will be joining [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://www.rose-hulman.edu) as an Assistant Professor in 2018 Fall. I obtained my Ph.D. in 2018 from [Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Notre Dame](http://cse.nd.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Aaron Striegel](http://sites.nd.edu/aaron-striegel/).


Research Interest
------
My research interests broadly focus on wireless networking and mobile computing, including WiFi/Cellular performance improvement, network measurement, and security applications. My research experience traverses multiple network layers, from the Software-defined radio (SDR) at the PHY layer to packet permutation at Transport layer.

I also participate in smartphone-driven interdisciplinary research that aims at exploring network effects from a sociological perspective, e.g., [NetSense](http://netsense.nd.edu/about.html) and [NetHealth](http://http://nethealth.nd.edu/)  project.
