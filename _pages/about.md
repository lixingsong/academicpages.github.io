I'm currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student at [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](http://cse.nd.edu/)  at University of Notre Dame. I work at NetScale Lab under supervision of [Prof. Aaron Striegel](http://sites.nd.edu/aaron-striegel/) . Before joined Notre Dame at 2014, I got my B.S of Electrical Engineering from Wuhan University[Wuhan University](http://en.whu.edu.cn/) , China at 2011. Then I worked as Research Assistant of [Prof. Shaoen Wu](http://www.cs.bsu.edu/homepages/swu/)  at School of Computing@[University of Southern Mississippi](http://www.usm.edu/)  (2011-2013) and Department of Computer Science@[Ball State University](http://cms.bsu.edu/)  (2013-2014). I attained my M.S. degree from Ball State University at 2014.


Research Interest
------
My research interests mainly focus on wireless networking and mobile computing, including WiFi/Cellular performance improvement, network measurement and security applications. My research experience traverses multiple network layers, from Software-defined radio (SDR) at PHY layer to packet permutation at Transport layer.

I also participate in smartphone-driven interdisciplinary research that aims to exploring network effects from a sociological perspective, e.g., [NetSense](http://netsense.nd.edu/about.html) and [NetHealth](http://http://nethealth.nd.edu/)  project. 

Teaching
-----------
I'm Teaching Assistant for the following courses:

* [Understanding Wireless: Technology, Economics, and Policy](https://www.edx.org/course/understanding-wireless-technology-notredamex-eg240x)
